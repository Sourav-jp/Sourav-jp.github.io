# Updated Portfolio content

What I updated
- Replaced placeholder content with details from the resume:
  - Name: Sourav J Prakash
  - Role: Cyber Security Analyst
  - Profile summary, phone, email, LinkedIn
  - Skills, programming languages and tool list
  - Projects (Petvet, Walkwell, Na-Node)
  - Education and certification
- Kept the animated background, reveal animations, layout and theme intact.

Next steps
- Place your resume PDF in the site folder and name it `resume.pdf` so the Download button works.
- If you want exact project links or additional projects added, paste the URLs and short descriptions and I'll update cards.
- If you want different estimated skill percentages, tell me the numbers and I'll change them.
- I can also prepare a ready-to-push ZIP or create a GitHub repo for you and add a GitHub Pages deployment instruction.
